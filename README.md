# Womens Work is (Screen) Saved
Women’s Work is (Screen) Saved is a screensaver bundle of images that displays reflections made by women workers—surveyed on the virtual job board, Mturk.com—on their lives, livelihood, and relationship to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many women wrote that their lives were profoundly changed, the details shared by women workers highlights the variety of effects the pandemic has had on women around the globe. Some share physical changes, citing leg pains, spinal pains, weight loss (a result of “forgetting to eat throughout the day while working from home,” writes one worker), weight gain, and more. Others write about increased anxiety, and other emotional stresses. Reflecting on her relationship with her grandchildren, one woman wrote, “You can’t hug through Zoom.” Created to amplify women’s working experiences during the pandemic, this digital artwork transforms texts collected on Amazon’s virtual job board into virtual postcards made for the screens that we cannot hug through at the ubiquitous pandemic worksite location: the home office.
